# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Challenge for the Tec de Monterrey Data Analysis Bootcamp, Introduction to Pandas

The Jupyter Notebook File for this exercise is named Main_PyCitySchools.ipynb, and it's inside of the PyCitySchools folder. 
It takes information from 2 CSV Files that exist within the Resources folder, that is at the same level of the PyCitySchools folder.

This notebook is an analysis of schools and student grade information, with a focus on analyzing it to extract insights and make conclusions from that data. The objective of the exercise was to use DataFrames and Pandas methods, so importing Pandas is necessary for the script to run, but the top of the notebook has a summary of results written in Markdown, to make it easier to understand the information.
